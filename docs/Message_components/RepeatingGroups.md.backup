# Repeating groups


Some  of the messages contain **repeating tag groups**.

A repeating tag group consists of repeating tag sets and starts with a tag that specifies the number of repeating sets. 

!!! exemp "Example"

    There is a `NoPositions` repeating group, which consists of the `NoPositions` tag that specifies the number of repeating tag sets and `PosType`, `LongQty`, and `ShortQty` tags that repeat. If `NoPositions` = 2, then in a FIX message,the `NoPositions` repeating group looks as follows:

    `NoPositions=2 PosType =1 LongType ShortType PosType LongType ShortType`
 
    In the FIX message descriptions, a tag that repeats in a repeating group is marked as 'Repeating tag'.
